## Overview
This project is a data analysis and visualization project focused on air quality data. It includes code for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration. T You will get a good understanding of air quality in different cities as well as patterns and relationships that may exist in the data. If there are any specific details about the dataset or further questions, please let us know!
## Project Structure
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the raw CSV data files.
- `AirQty.ipnyb`: Python scripts for data wrangling, EDA, and answering analysis questions.
- `dashboard.py`: The Streamlit dashboard application.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git
```
2. Install the required Python packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Wrangling**: Data wrangling scripts are available in the `notebook.py` file to prepare and clean the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and analyze the data using the provided Python scripts. EDA insights can guide your understanding of air quality patterns.

3. **Visualization**: Run the Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration:

```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
Access the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Data Sources
The project uses air quality data from [Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python's Final Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RhU3gJlkteaAQfyn9XOVAz7a5o1-etgr/view) offered by [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Summarize key findings and insights from the EDA process.

## Visualization
Include the visualizations created by the Streamlit dashboard.
